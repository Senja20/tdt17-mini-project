# Mini Project - TDT17

## Object detection with YOLO Model

NB: We used IDUN, therefore the path to the dataset corresponds to the location on idun

* **yolo_recognition**: runs the training of the model
* **create_inference_video**: creates a video out of the validation data, can be done with sahi or without. Also used to create ground truth video
* **model/model_inference**: used to validate and explore the trained model
* **train_tuned2**: The final model used in the presentation
* **best_hyperparameters**: The best parameters found by tuning
* **validation.ipynb**: Used to print model performance
